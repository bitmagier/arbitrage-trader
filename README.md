# arbitrage-trader

An autonomously working arbitrage trader platform for crypto assets

This arbitrage trader is fully configurable. It connects to a number of crypto exchanges 	(currently Binance, Bitfinex and Coinbase) and monitors the trades. It looks for price differences of the same trading pair on these different exchanges. When it finds an arbitrage trading pattern, to leverage from that price difference, it automatically starts the	necessary transactions.
